        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until one day, you walk.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This. is. learning.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just don’t get it, yet.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe 
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever you are, wherever you <em>are.</em><br>

        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
